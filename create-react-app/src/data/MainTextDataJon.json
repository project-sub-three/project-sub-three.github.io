      "text":"Jonathan grew up with a pedigree of cycling in his family, his grandfather was a prolific 24-hour champion in the 1930s and a lifelong touring cyclist. Jonathan began his own competitive cycling at the age of 14. As academia took priority Jonathan studied an undergraduate degree in genetics at Leeds university and subsequently became a science teacher. In 2013/14 Jonathan circumnavigated the world by bicycle, passing across three continents and through 29 countries, on a 33,000 km journey. Only three weeks after finishing his global expedition Jonathan won the British 24-hour time trial championship. In 2018 while working in the Middle East Jonathan set a world record for the 1300km crossing of Oman by bicycle in a time of 47-hours. In early 2019 Jonathan, along with Imran Mughal became one of the first two men to cycle across North africas’s Maghreb and later that year won the prestigious British Best All-Rounder time trial championship.",
